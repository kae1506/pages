# why?

I like the NBA. I also like consuming long-form content about it but with my minuscule attention span, the only thing I draw away from is the GRAPHS.

(yes this is inspired by jxmyhighroller)

so I decided to see if I could make some of my own  graphs, and maybe even make them interactive and put them on the web to fuel all the nba arguments for years to come.

# what?

originally, the plan was just to make graphs using NBA data. and the first thing in it was 

## sourcing the data ##

there are majorly three ways to source data that I've found. one would be to find and manually download data from websites. and since the data i need is in the magnitudes of thousands there is 
absolutely no way thats viable. secondly, I could download datasets of information. it would be concise, easy to work with and very scalable but since i want data that updates on its own
the only option I was left with was APIs.
