# why?

I like the NBA. I also like consuming long-form content about it but with my minuscule attention span, the only thing I draw away from is the GRAPHS.

(yes this is inspired by jxmyhighroller)

so I decided to see if I could make some of my own  graphs, and maybe even make them interactive and put them on the web to fuel all the nba arguments for years to come.

# what?

originally, the plan was just to make graphs using NBA data. and the first thing in it was 

## sourcing the data 

there are majorly three ways to source data that I've found. one would be to find and manually download data from websites. and since the data i need is in the magnitudes of thousands there is 
no way thats viable. secondly, I could download datasets of information. it would be concise, easy to work with and very scalable but since i want data that updates on its own
the only option I was left with was APIs. 

statmuse doesnt have an api afaik and neither does basketball reference. bballref does allow you to down excel sheets of data but again there is no way im doing that. 
stats.nba.com does have an api, but it isnt easy to access and i couldnt find it so i decided to look for third-party wrappers on the stats.nba API.

the one i ended up using (https://github.com/swar/nba_api/)[this one] which is actually really well made and i havent even scratched the surface of all it has

it is in the end a wrapper on the NBA api so it does have those endpoints. makes it easier for anyone to conform with
